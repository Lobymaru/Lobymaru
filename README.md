- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lobymaru
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Java and React for the moment.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web development (I'm a partner of Mercado Pago now, so I can integrate their payment gateway), and soon I'll start learning to work with the Spring Framework, also I'll attemp to build a card game on React and PixiJS, wish me luck 🤞.
- 📫 How to reach me Lobymaru@gmail.com or LobatoFrancoR@gmail.com

- 😅 Almost forgot, you can check the following pages that I'm developing:
    <br/>✨ https://react-fcnc.vercel.app it's a webpage for a foundation that my dad participates. It was a project to self taught me about web development and ReactJS, so it's a little rough on the edges
    <br/>✨ https://card-hero-gbc-catalogue.vercel.app it's a calaogue of all the cards from the game "Trade & Battle: Card Hero" for the Game Boy Color. (Note: The API is hosted in Render.com, so if the images doesn't load at first it's because the API it's suspended, try again in 30 to 60 seconds so it can "wake up". If the problem presist, contact me by E-mail.)
    <br/>✨ https://es-reservas-online.vercel.app It's a web app that let's you make a reservation through a calendar. It reads and write from a Google Sheet Document. But becasuse of the life span of the Tokens, it might no be working so make sure to e-mail me if you whant to see it in action, in the meanwhile you can check this video of me showing and explaining the project, be advice, english is not my native language ---> https://www.loom.com/share/0cc42c983efe4303b1ef61aa4005a90d
