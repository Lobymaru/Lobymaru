- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lobymaru
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Java and React for the moment.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web development, and soon I'll start learning to work with the Spring Framework, also I'll attemp to build a card game on React, wish me luck 🤞.
- 📫 How to reach me Lobymaru@gmail.com or LobatoFrancoR@gmail.com

- 😅 Almost forgot, you can check the following pages that I'm developing:
    <br/>✨ https://react-fcnc.vercel.app it's a webpage for a foundation that my dad participates. It was a project to self taught me about web development and ReactJS, so it's a little rough on the edges
    <br/>✨ https://card-hero-gbc-catalogue.vercel.app it's a calaogue of all the cards from the game "Trade & Battle: Card Hero" for the Game Boy Color. (Note: The API is hosted in Render.com, so if the images doesn't load at first it's because the API it's suspended, try again in 30 to 60 seconds so it can "wake up". If the problem presist, contact me by E-mail.)
